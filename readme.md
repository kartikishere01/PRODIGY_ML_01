This project implements an advanced house price prediction system using linear regression on the Ames Housing dataset. The pipeline includes careful data cleaning, domain driven feature engineering, missing value handling, quality and area aggregation, polynomial and logarithmic feature transformations, and neighborhood based price encoding. Regularized linear models Ridge and ElasticNet are trained and combined using a stacking approach to capture both stable and sparse patterns in the data. The target variable is log transformed to handle price skew and improve linear fit. The final model achieves a validation RMSE of approximately 0.1317, which is close to the practical performance limit of linear models on this dataset. The repository contains the trained models, scaler, and prediction output, allowing full reproducibility and further experimentation.
